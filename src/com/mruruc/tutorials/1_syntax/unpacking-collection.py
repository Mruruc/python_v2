# Unpack a Collection
# If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc.
# Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.

# similar to javaScript destructuring

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)

a, b, c = fruits

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# we can use more than one argument inside print function;

print("===========================")
print(a, b, c)
